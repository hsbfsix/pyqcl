# pyqcl
### Python Quantum Computing example code

This is essentially just a way for me to practice the stuff from the book "Quantum Computation and Quantum Infromation" by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang.<br>
pyqcl currently only supports basic quantum gates, and algorithms upto the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Basically, the basics.<br>
A tutorial on quantum computing using pyqcl is also in the works.
